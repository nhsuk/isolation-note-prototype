      <h1 class="nhsuk-u-margin-bottom-5">Check an isolation note</h1>
      <p>Use this service if you are an employer and want to check that a coronavirus isolation note is valid.</p>
      <p>An isolation note is proof that an employee needs to self-isolate because of coronavirus and cannot go to work.</p>
      <h2 class="nhsuk-heading-m">Before you start</h2>
      <p>To check an isolation note is valid, you need:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>the 16 digit reference number on the isolation note</li>
        <li>the employee's date of birth</li>
      </ul>
         
      <a class="nhsuk-button" href="/{{version}}/check/reference-number">Start now</a>
      
      <p>By using this service you are agreeing to our <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/nhs-services/the-nhs-app/isolation-note/terms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">terms of use</a> and <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/nhs-services/the-nhs-app/isolation-note/privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">privacy policy</a>.</p>
      
      <h2 class="nhsuk-heading-m">What you need to know as an employer</h2> 
      <p>Isolation notes are for employees who:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>have symptoms of coronavirus or have tested positive</li>
        <li>live with someone who has symptoms or has tested positive, and the employee is not fully vaccinated</li>
        <li>have been told to self-isolate by NHS Test and Trace or the NHS COVID-19 app</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Employees under the age of 18 years and 6 months, only need to self-isolate if they have symptoms of coronavirus, or have tested positive.</p>
      <p>Use your discretion around the need for medical evidence if an employee has been told to self-isolate because of coronavirus.</p>
      <p>If you need evidence that an employee cannot work because of coronavirus, ask them to get an isolation note.</p>
      <p>Employees who cannot work because of coronavirus should avoid asking their GP for a fit note. This is to let doctors focus on their patients.</p>

        <p><strong>Working from home</strong></p>
        <p>To prevent the spread of coronavirus, you should encourage your employees to work from home, wherever possible.</p>
        <p>If an employee is well enough to work, and can work from home, they do not need an isolation note.</p>
